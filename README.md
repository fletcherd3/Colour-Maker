# Colour-Maker
This is a quick script I made to generate a whole bunch of colours for. It's not perfect!

I wanted to have my background constantly changing colour using the mac auto background
refresh thing but I couldn't find a download of a lot of colours.

The advantage of making this was I could choose exactly how many colours I 
wanted and the size of the image.

I found the minimum size I could use was 2x2px so I used this to speed up the
time.
